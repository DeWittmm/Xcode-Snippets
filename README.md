# Xcode Snippets

My snippets aggregated from a variety of sources (See Thanks To). All files are in codesnippet format ready to be added directly to UserData, with orignal dotfiles included from fork. 

## Install Snippets

Move to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets


## Thanks To

Mainly [NSHipster] (http://nshipster.com/xcode-snippets/)

And [@lichtschlag](https://github.com/lichtschlag/Xcode-4-Code-Snippets) for the idea to use .codesnippet files directly and some additional snippets.
